# MIPS-Processor
Implementation of MIPS(Micropocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) Processor using verilog
# Goal
The design was intended as the final project for the course: Laboratory, Computer Organisation and Computer Architecture. The objective was to implement a simplified MIPS Processor capable of executing subset of MIPS instructions. It should handle operations such as arithmetic and logic operations, register transfers, memory load/store and conditional branching. The main challenges included designing individual hardware modules, then integrating them into a top module - creating a working processor, capable of executing instructions correctly, while ensuring correct data flow and control signal generation. 
# Project Implementation
Processor was divided into the following modules: 
* Program Counter
* Memory
* Instruction Decoder
* Register File
* Immediate Extender
* ALU
* Shifter
* Branch Control
* Top Module
